# CS-465

Project Overview 

This full stack web application caters to both customers and administrators. It ensures a seamless user experience for customers, while providing secure login for administrators to protect sensitive data. The final version prioritizes security measures to safeguard admin login information.

Architecture 

The frontend was developed using Express HTML, JavaScript, and a Single-Page Application (SPA) methodology. Express HTML served static pages and integrated with backend routes, while JavaScript enabled interactive elements and event handling. The SPA approach enhanced performance by updating content without refreshing the entire page. The backend utilizes MongoDB due to its flexibility, scalability, and JSON-like structure, facilitating easy data exchange between the frontend and backend. Unlike traditional databases, MongoDB offers adaptable data storage, accommodating evolving application requirements.

Functionality 

JSON, a lightweight data format, contrasts with JavaScript in that it does not support functions or methods. It is crucial for linking the frontend and backend, ensuring data is shared in a clear and organized manner. Efficiency was improved by structuring API routes, optimizing database queries, and creating reusable UI components such as forms and buttons. These enhancements made the application more maintainable and faster.

Testing

The API was tested to ensure accurate and safe request processing and data retrieval. Authentication tests confirmed that only authorized users could access admin features. Error handling was implemented to manage failed API requests. Security was bolstered by encrypting passwords, implementing safeguards against unauthorized access, and securing API communication with HTTPS and tokens.

Reflection 

This course has significantly advanced my full stack development skills, including deploying web applications, managing databases, following security best practices, and developing APIs. I gained practical experience in integrating frontend and backend systems, managing user authentication, and optimizing performance. These skills have strengthened my candidacy for software engineering positions.
